## AtliQ Mart Delivery Performance Analysis Powerbi Project

Completed an exciting project in the FMCG industry with Resume Project Challenge #2 conducted by codebasics. Here’s a breakdown of the project's key highlights and my learnings:

## Project Overview:
AtliQ Mart, a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India, is expanding its operations and wants to ensure top-notch delivery service to retain key customers. The goal was to track and improve their ‘On-time delivery (OT) %’, ‘In-full delivery (IF) %’, ‘On-Time In Full (OTIF) %’, ‘Line Item Fill Rate (LIFR) %’, and ‘Volume Fill Rate (VOFR) %’ against target service levels.

## Key Takeaways:
1. Created and visualized metrics for OT %, IF %, OTIF %, LIFR %, and VOFR % to monitor service levels.
2. Implemented a dashboard to track delivery performance over time, enabling swift responses to potential issues.
3. Used advanced Power BI features to create interactive and insightful visualizations, including sparklines and custom charts.

## Findings:
1. Underperformance in OTIF: The OTIF % was significantly below target in several instances, indicating frequent delivery issues.
2. City-wise Performance Disparities: Delivery performance varied widely across Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara.
3. Customer-specific Issues: Some key customers faced consistent service issues, risking contract renewals.

## Suggestions:
1. Review and optimize logistics workflows to minimize delays and incomplete deliveries.
2. Improve communication channels between supply chain teams and customers to manage expectations and resolve issues promptly.
3. Focus on underperforming cities and customers with specific strategies to meet service level targets.
4. Establish a routine monitoring system to track delivery performance and address issues proactively.

## Tools Used:
* Power BI: For creating data visualizations and interactive dashboards.
* DAX:For crafting advanced calculations and measures to derive insights.

## Learnings:
This project has been incredibly enlightening! Here’s a snapshot of my involvement:
* Metric Development: Created key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure delivery performance.
* Data Analysis: Conducted in-depth analysis to uncover trends and root causes of delivery issues.
* Dashboard Design: Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualise
performance metrics and trends.
